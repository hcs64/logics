<h1>Logics report fragments</h1>

<p>
Here I am going to host sections of a report on the branch of <span class="term">formal logic</span> called <span class="term">modal logic</span>. It is hard to tell what shape this will take so far, but I intend to deal mostly with <span class="term">dynamic logics</span> (<span class="term">propositional</span> and <span class="term">first order</span>), with some discussion of <span class="term">linear time temporal logic</span> and possibly <span class="term">autoepistemic logic</span>.
</p>

<p>
This will also serve as a playground for me to experiment with <span>MathJax</span> and active web content in general. Hopefully it will be usable and readable but that is not the primary goal, or so I tell myself.
</p>
<p>
In particular I am not going to be concentrating on historical aspects. I will add a list of references that I have studied, but I will not make any effort to track down the origins of ideas.

<div class="detail-section" id="formal-logic">
<small>A brief explanation of</small>
<h2>Formal logic</h2>
<p>
Formal logic takes its name from dealing with the form of logical statements.
It should be possible to identify statements that are logically true, and construct valid arguments, purely at a structural level, once a few basic axioms are granted.
If there is an error in the logic, then, it should not have much space in which to hide.
</p>
<p>
There are two basic approaches to establishing the truth of statements:
<ul>
<li>evaluation (semantically-oriented, this encompasses model checking, satisfiability, etc)</li>
<li>proof (syntactically-oriented, theorem proving)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Evaluation consists of taking a well-formed formula (wff) and, based on its structure and rules for the meaning (semantics) of each subexpression, determining the overall meaning of the formula. When the truth of propositions used in the formula are known, this is trivial. When we must instead determine whether there is any assignment of propositional variables that could make the expression true, i.e. whether the statement is satisfiable, this becomes a rather different problem, which is very difficult in general.
</p>
<p>
Formal proofs are a stylized form of argument, taking the approach of generating new true statements from previously accepted or proven statements. This is done entirely on a syntactic level. It can be used to determine the truth of statements only insofar as any statement for which a proof exists can be considered true. This may be approached by working backwards from the formula to be proved, trying to show how it follows from the axioms. The fundamental mechanism here is modus ponens, if <i>p</i> implies <i>q</i> is true and <i>p</i> is true, then <i>q</i> is true. A formal proof is a mathematical object just as a formula/statement/expression is, and one can think of the proving process as &quot;solving&quot; for a proof.
</p>
<p>
The relationship between the two approaches is usually expressed as questioning the validity of the proof method. You want to ensure two things:
<ul>
<li>soundness (aka consistency, proofs only exist for true statements)</li>
<li>completeness (a proof exists for any true statement)</li>
</ul>
where &quot;true statement&quot; is taken as &quot;something that evaluates to true&quot;.
</p>
<p>
Due to its mechanical nature, formal logic is perfectly suited for being interpreted mechanically. This is in itself a vast field of research.
</p>
<p>To be continued/improved...</p>
<p>Notes: I should be talking about model theory rather than &quot;evaluation&quot;, but I don't really understand it well enough to be comfortable with discussing it here.</p>

<div class="detail-section" id="modal-logic">
<small>A brief explanation of</small>
<h2>Modal logic</h2>
<p>Very basic formal logics, the kind that are the most thoroughly studied, particularly by nonspecialists like me, deal with a single state of the universe. A proposition is true, or it is false. There is no sense of what it has been, or what it could be, or how it might get to be that way. A natural way to understand modal logic is that it allows us to work with alternate universes.</p>
<p>Consider the passage of time. We might want to say that <i>p</i> will be true at some time in the future. This would be expressed in temporal logic as F<i>p</i>.</p>
<p>The F operator introduces another time relative to the current one, and all propositions in the context of that operator are making claims about a point in the future. There is also an operator G. G<i>p</i> means <i>p</i> will always be true in the future, though note that that doesn't mean <i>p</i> is <em>currently</em> true. That is, it is not the case that $\text{F}p \rightarrow p$.</p>
<p>What is perhaps a bit more interesting is to say &quot;$p$ will be true at some time in the future, and thereafter it will always be true&quot;. This would be expressed as $\text{F}(p \wedge \text{G}p)$.</p>
<p>You can see that F is interpreted as &quot;at some time in the <strong>F</strong>uture ...&quot;, while G is &quot;it is always <strong>G</strong>oing to be ...&quot;. 

<p>to be continued/improved</p>
<p>Notes: Perhaps it would make more sense to use the traditional possible world semantics here as the basic modal logic example rather than temporal logic, leave that for a discussion of temporal logic. It is probably easier to visualize visualization than it is to deal with all the tension of tenses in tense logic.</p>

// I guess the natural way to do this would be to just have every term on a
// different page and link between them, let the browser handle the concept

// terms in context, particularly when it is possible to do this in whatever
// order seems appropriate, and to have this order validated by the page
// displaying these sequentially (which is not at all something I have
// implemented yet). The page knowing the context may also allow for
