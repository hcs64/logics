<h1>Modal logics, temporal and dynamic</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This report deals with a branch of formal logic called
Propositional Modal Logic,
in which we are concerned with the truth of propositions.<br>
Our concern in a formal logic is to abstract away every detail that is not
necessary for preserving the validity of statements. Much reasoning is valid on 
a formal level: as long as the proper form is followed an argument will be
valid.
This abstraction allows logicians to study the structure of logic quite apart
from dealing with the specifics of arguments.
For instance, much of the work disucssed in this report has applications to
proving the correctness of computer programs,
though much of it was developed without any consideration of computers.

<p>
In the case of propositional logic we reduce statements to atomic propositions, joined by a very small family of logical connectives into larger propositions.</p>
An <i>atomic</i> proposition is defined to have no further internal structure that we are interested in. So if we have two atomic propositions
<ul>
<li><i>p</i> = &quot;My pants are blue&quot;</li>
<li><i>q</i> = &quot;My hair is black&quot;</li>
</ul>
we are ignoring any interesting contrasts or commonalities,
such as that both of these statements are about me, involve colors, and mention
two different colors. An atomic proposition only has an identity, like the
letters <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> here, which lets us know whether propositions can
be considered identical.<br>
This implies that, absent any other statements, there is no relation between
<i>p</i> and <i>q</i>; setting up these propositions doesn't even make any
claims about truth. If we want to claim that <i>p</i> is true, we must also
<i>assert</i> that <i>p</i> is true.

Propositional logic gets interesting once we start using connectives.
