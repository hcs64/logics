<h1>Modal logics, temporal and dynamic</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This report deals with a branch of formal logic called
Modal Logic, in which we are concerned with the truth of propositions in various
contexts, and how those contexts relate to each other logically.
Example contexts include points in time, conceivable worlds,
believable knowledge, and states of a computation.</p>
<p>
There is a good deal of theoretical mechanism that applies equally well to many
kinds of Modal Logic, such as a the unifying Kripke semantics. The essential
core of Kripke semantics is a binary relation on the &quot;worlds&quot;, which
defines how propositions in one world may be referenced by propositions in
another. I will give examples for these vague remarks for the two logics we will
consider, Temporal Logic and Dynamic Logic.
</p>
<p>
In Temporal Logic the contexts are points in time.
Times are related by the relations
&quot;<i>s</i> is in the past of <i>t</i>&quot; and
&quot;<i>s</i> is in the future of <i>t</i>&quot;.
We can use temporal logic to express statements with reference to some or all
future or past times, such as
&quot;<i>p</i> or <i>q</i> will be true&quot; or
&quot;if <i>r</i> was always true, <i>r</i> is true&quot;.
These are useful, for instance, for verifying the eventual proper behavior of
programs,
invariants such as &quot;if the operating system gets a request, it will
eventually grant the request&quot;.
</p>

<p>
In Dynamic Logic the contexts are the states of an executing program,
and there are infinitely many relations: the input/output relations of programs.
This lets us express such statements as
&quot;when program <i>a</i> finishes, <i>p</i> is true&quot; and
&quot;if <i>p</i> or <i>q</i> are true, then when program <i>b</i> finishes, <i>q</i> is true&quot;.
This can be useful for formally specifying correctness properties, however the
generality of the technique has mostly seen only theoretical use.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Formal logic</h3>
<p>
Our concern in a formal logic is to abstract away every detail that is not
necessary for preserving the validity of statements. Much reasoning is valid on 
a formal level: as long as the proper form is followed an argument will be
valid.
This abstraction allows logicians to study the structure of logic quite apart
from dealing with the specifics of arguments, and it encourages attention to the
essential details of a situation.
</p>

<h3>Propositions</h3>
<p>
In the case of propositional logic, we reduce statements to atomic propositions, joined by a very small family of logical connectives into larger propositions.</p>
<p>
A <i>proposition</i> is simply a statement which we regard to be true or false.
An <i>atomic proposition</i> is defined to have no further internal structure that we are interested in.</p>
<p>So if we have two atomic propositions
<ul>
<li><i>p</i> = &quot;My pants are blue&quot;</li>
<li><i>q</i> = &quot;My hair is black&quot;</li>
</ul>
we are ignoring any interesting contrasts or commonalities,
such as that both of these statements are about me and involve colors.
An atomic proposition only has an identity, like the
letters <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> here, which lets us know whether propositions can
be considered identical.<br>
This implies that, absent any other statements, there is no relation between
<i>p</i> and <i>q</i>; setting up these propositions doesn't even make any
claims about truth. If we want to claim that <i>p</i> is true, we must also
<i>assert</i> that <i>p</i> is true.
</p>

<h3>Connectives</h3>
<p>
Propositional logic gets interesting once we start using logical connectives. If we wanted to state &quot;my pants are blue and my hair is black&quot;, we might introduce a new atomic
