<h1>Modal logics, temporal and dynamic</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This report deals with a branch of formal logic called Propositional Modal Logicin which we are concerned with the truth of propositions.<br>
A <i>proposition</i> is a statement that is considered to be true or false, such as:
<ol>
<li>&quot;It is raining.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The sky is green.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;If the sky is green, it will never rain again.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;It could rain or it could snow, maybe both.&quot;</li>
</ol>
Some propositions will be considered <i>atomic</i>, meaning indivisible, because we will not consider them to be made out of simpler concepts. We could analyze &quot;it is raining&quot; as a statement about weather, at some time, and regarding some weather condition, or we could ignore those details if we are only interested in the truth of the overall statement. Propositions 1 and 2 above can be treated in this way.
</p>

<p>
<i>Note:</i> I think I am going off the deep end a bit with these explanations, I need a better feeling for audience. Then again the distinction between what we care about and build in implicitly to a logical system, and what we instead consider to be incidental, is an important point to be made.<br>
I could get away with a lot less explanation if we stuck with points of mathematical or CS logic, I guess. Then I would be excluding certain people from the audience automatically at such an early stage.<br>
But look at the rest of the outline. There is no way that I can make a mom-friendly treatment all the way through. Is that a challenge?
